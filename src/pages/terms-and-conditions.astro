            In no event shall Astrobot.Design or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, 
            damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability 
            to use the materials on Astrobot.Design, even if Astrobot.Design or an authorized representative has been

          <p>
