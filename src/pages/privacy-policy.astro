          <p class="mb-4">
            All materials and information shared with Astrobot.Design as part of a project are treated as confidential.
          </p>
          
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><strong class="text-foreground">Confidentiality:</strong> Design briefs, creative files, and project communications are used only to fulfill the agreed scope of work.</li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-foreground">Storage:</strong> Project data is securely managed through Bloom.io, our primary client and project portal. 
              Bloom.io serves as a central hub for communication, file delivery, and project tracking.
              <p class="mt-1">Supporting project documentation and internal records may also be stored in Notion, used as an auxiliary data workspace connected to our systems for organization and workflow management.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong class="text-foreground">Access:</strong> Only authorized Astrobot.Design team members directly involved in your project have access to related information or assets.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-foreground">Automation:</strong> Limited data may pass through Zapier or n8n.com to automate internal workflows such as notifications, file organization, or task management. These automations do not analyze or share project content.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-foreground">Anonymized Use:</strong> Aggregated, de-identified project data (such as completion statistics or case study summaries) may be used internally for performance review, system optimization, or educational purposes — never in a way that identifies clients.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            We uphold strict confidentiality standards to ensure that all creative and project information remains private, secure, and used only for its intended purpose.

            We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information.

          </p>
          
          <p>
            While no digital system can be guaranteed completely secure, we take ongoing steps to
